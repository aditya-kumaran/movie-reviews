Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the most consistently likable character, but Patrick is cool enough to give him the win here. Most of the other characters are pretty annoying (high school movie, so not really surprising) and the plot does complicate itself a little too much, but the 90s comedy is still more entertaining than most of what is put out today. Pretty cookie-cutter plot, to the point where I could probably have guessed the entire script in broad strokes just from the IMDb synopsis, but the individual moments work together to make it stand out from all the other 90s high-school rom-coms out there. Speech at the end is not bad, I guess, and the massive song is setting the bar way too high for promposals. Also I find it weird how Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) just kisses Cameron and he stops thinking she\u2019s awful, but whatever works, I guess.",

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have pretty good chemistry, and their characters are pretty naturally funny, so it\u2019s definitely just a good funny movie to watch. The hallucination scenes had me proper laughing, and the supporting cast is cool too. Ice Cube, Rob Riggle, and Dakota Johnson (obviously super good looking) are good comedic sides, but Brie Larson was the most impressive actor here. After all the bad press she\u2019s been getting (after Captain Marvel) it was good to see that she\u2019s actually charming and a great actor. Anyway, the way the movie made fun of most of the modern school stereotypes is cool, and overall it\u2019s a good all-nighter popcorn flick.",

I did see this like a month before going to college, so I was totally scarred by the experience, even after considering that it was Hollywood college.

And even though this movie (if you want to call it that - it\u2019s really three chapters) is formally listed as a \u201cromance drama\u201d, I really think it\u2019s more realistic than most of the romance movies I\u2019ve seen. I mean this straight up broke my heart, \u201c500 days of summer\u201d style. I\u2019m relatively naive, so I haven\u2019t completely given up on love (like Takaki), so pretty much everything he does hits REALLY hard. His relationship with Akari (Yoshimi Kondou) from the time they\u2019re kids to adults is the focus of the movie, and that\u2019s really all you need to know. It\u2019s visually beautiful (as usual) and the visual storytelling is wonderful for both insightful and casual viewers. My only issue was that it\u2019s plot didn\u2019t have too many events, and maybe a longer runtime might have helped with that. But for what it is, it\u2019ll definitely give you something to think about. Warning though, it might break your heart.",

But I guess that\u2019s what the movie was about - relationships fade. Love fades, if you allow it to. Killed me. Takaki being emotionally unavailable around Kanae also hit home. And knowing that Akari got married without Takaki even knowing\u2026 my heart hurts even now. Love is hard, man. So yeah, Shinkai does it again. I don\u2019t really know why they spent all that time focusing on Kanae\u2019s family and sister and stuff, but there must be some reason. Also apparently the falling cherry blossom petals are a metaphor for relationships growing apart with time? Mad. I really liked the callback though, it was cute.",

Take a guess which one this movie chooses. There\u2019s so much tragedy in each character\u2019s mind that you don\u2019t know who to hate and when (lesson: kids suck). The director, Naoko Yamada, does a great job with motifs and visual storytelling for Ishida\u2019s (Miyu Iruno) character. His relationship with the other characters in school, mainly the deaf Nishimiya, is the main plot of this movie. But it is TRAGIC. Not in the Julius Caesar way, but in a really psychologically probing way. The animation is great, the voice acting is wonderful (especially for the Winner) and the plot is something that no one should miss out on. The entire ensemble of characters, Yuzuru (Ao Yuki), Ueno (Yuki Kaneko), Nagatsuka (Kensho Ono), Kawai (Megumi Han), and Sahara (Yui Ishikawa) all represent distinct types of people with real flaws, making the movie hit home to that many more people. The parents, especially Nishimiya\u2019s mom (Akiko Hiramatsu) and Ishida\u2019s mom (Satsuki Yurino) have such devastating reactions to the events in the movie as well. Definitely important to watch, if you\u2019re prepared to understand many complex characters. And if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll definitely appreciate the messages about the unseen struggles that deaf people endure - I\u2019m going to try and learn ASL as soon as possible.",

But kids are going to be horrible, right? So it made sense. And that\u2019s why I was that much angrier at Ueno when she started messing with Nishimiya when they were older. And Kawai\u2019s random outbursts? Loathing. The number of suicide attempts in this movie, too\u2026 it\u2019s definitely an important thing to recognize the reactions of the family and friends. So yeah, not the most rewatchable movie, not the most consistently comfortable, but it\u2019s powerful and has a great message.",

Lady Gaga was awesome at flexing her voice, as well as her emotional acting, and Bradley Cooper as Jackson Maine was definitely a really cool deuteragonist. They had great chemistry, and Cooper\u2019s directing was really complimentary to stressing the emotional instability of both of the main characters. Bobby (Sam Elliot) was definitely a good emotional backup to Jackson\u2019s story, Ramon (Anthony Ramos) was funny, and Rez (Rafi Gavron) played a vital role in delving into the effects of going into showbusiness and the kind of people who have influence over artists\u2019 creativity. Shallow is the highlight, of course, just an absolute great song, and I\u2019m glad that they used it so well in the movie. The intimacy between Ally and Jackson was really unique and personal, and Jackson\u2019s drinking issues were definitely a factor in everything that happened.

Saba (Aishwarya Rai) and Ali (Fawad Khan) were the supporting cast, and I thought Rai did a pretty great job, but Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s one-scene cameo absolutely stole the show, his lines completely summing up what the movie was about. The dialogue is actually great for the most part, particularly the banter between the characters and the poetry-type scenes. Obviously, music was great, especially the wedding scene. Theme-wise this movie was also really mature, and I was glad that it didn\u2019t have any gimmicky elements that were a staple of this genre. Definitely a solid effort all around.",

Their language was probably the star of this movie, as was the characters\u2019 conversation of language\u2019s connection to cognition and how we as a species think because of how we communicate. Watching Louise teach the aliens and learn their language was really cool to watch as time went on, and the world powers\u2019 reaction to the situation looked pretty reasonable (unfortunately for us in the real world).

With all the OG Avengers at center stage, all the favorites had a healthy amount of screentime with decent to excellent resolutions/continuations of their character arcs. Score was decent (can\u2019t go wrong with Silvestri), even if it didn\u2019t seem to match up to Infinity War\u2019s. Pacing felt kind of inconsistent, but there\u2019s a lot going on, so it\u2019s forgivable to have rushed in places. Though there are some really powerful shots, overall the visuals weren\u2019t quite as stunning as Infinity War\u2019s. The cinematography felt average, and the color palette was more muted for no particularly good reason, especially during the third act, which could not have chosen a more boring place to happen. Humor was on point, and this movie brought in ALL THE FEELS. Ton of fan service, which is to be expected. Thanos is a far less interesting villain than in his last outing, and his power scaling is a little messed up, but he remains as intimidating as ever. Very rewarding watch, even if those without prior MCU knowledge will be a bit lost. The greatest danger here is overwatching, since Endgame is meant as the culmination of everything that came before it, so it doesn\u2019t work as well without that emotional setup.",

The relationship between Felicie (Elle Fanning) and Victor (Dane DeHaan) is honestly one of the most charming animated movie kid pairings, and watching them contend against the world is really inspiring. I felt like Odette\u2019s kindness and calm, motherly personality was just spectacular in contrast to the kids, and they fit extremely well together - so glad that she got her respect at the end. Camille LeHaut (Maddie Ziegler) and Rudolph (Tamir Kepallan) kept the narrative interesting too, even if the Mrs. LeHaut (Kate McKinnon) was totally cartoonishly crazy. Luteau (Mel Brooks) was also really heartwarming at the end - shows the power of a good dream. Movie is also called LEAP! But I think the international release is Ballerina, and I think this movie\u2019s charm is its European influence, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve chosen.",

The beast (Dan Stevens) was a pretty cool character, but the supporting cast really stole the show, especially Lumiere and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), who have hilarious banter, and LeFou (Josh Gad), who\u2019s great comic relief.

There\u2019s so many little pop-culture inserts with Chris Rock as a mosquito, Larry King as himself, Ray Liotta as himself, etc. But the message of the movie is actually still decently meaningful in that it expresses the importance of bees\u2019 existence to our ecosystems.

Bucky\u2019s exclusion was probably a good idea, since the film focused on entirely new characters.

I kept waiting for the third act to start, but the movie kinda just ended, so I felt a little unsatisfied. I don\u2019t remember anything wrong about the movie per se, maybe the pacing, but Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) is cool as always and Yelena is an awesome new addition to the MCU. I like the familial dynamic between the girls, Melina (Rachel Weisz) and Alexei (David Harbour). Supporting cast of Ross (William Hurt) and Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). The plug Agent (O. T. Fagbenle) was funny, but the villains were a little meh. Taskmaster\u2019s concept was cool, but I felt they misused Olga Kurylenko and misplayed the emotional stakes with the whole Budapest callback. Dreykov (Ray Winstone) was interesting, but his menacingness did evaporate way too quickly. The action itself was pretty good though, even if it\u2019s difficult to believe they survive so many explosions and car crashes. Also this movie is almost entirely women, and it worked so well that nobody really noticed or made a big noise about it. People were comparing it to Captain Marvel, and this movie isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s less forced, and its focus is rightly on Natasha and her bond with family.",

Their young actresses (Ever Gabo Anderson and Violet McGraw respectively) did really well too. My favourite part of the movie was probably the montage with a slow acapella Smells Like Teen Spirit (by Malia J, original by Nirvana). Really really dark scenes, but they were really hard-hitting. Definitely great backstory to Natasha\u2019s character that we\u2019ve only heard of. I found Dreykov\u2019s whole pheromone thing really stupid, and Natasha\u2019s severed nerve thing was arguably even worse - him dying fell pretty flat too. The scene at the end where she looks into the distance as Ross and his cars show up really confused me, since they were just trying to arrest her earlier, and she ends up totally fine. So that was a little wack. I also really wanted Captain America to show up at the end, so that was sad.",

But it\u2019s really more in line with ethical, speculative science-fiction that isn\u2019t as popular as you\u2019d think. The movie is based around human-like androids called \u2018replicants\u2019 having escaped some prison/factory and Rick having to kill them (he\u2019s a space policeman, which they call Blade Runner). So the message here is asking the audience what really differentiates the replicants from humans, if anything - especially given the characters\u2019 vast repulsion with replicants. Roy, Pris (Daryl Hannah), and Rachael (Sean Young) all give great performances, and the end scene from Roy is easily the best and most pronounced scene in the movie. Pacing is pretty slow, and you really have to stick in there to last to the last 20 minutes (the good bit).",

Also Roy\u2019s acting was great, but he kept doing really weird things for no reason (especially in the third act). The conversation between him and Tyrell (Joe Turkel) was good though.",

Visually it\u2019s obviously a huge step up from 1982, and Hans Zimmer is about as close as you can get to a spiritual successor for Vangelis\u2019s iconic score. K (Ryan Gosling) shows a ridiculous amount of subtlety in his performance given how stoic his character is supposed to be outwardly, and his holographic girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas) was both an interesting concept and enjoyable to watch. Some scenes run a little long probably\u2014Villeneuve\u2019s Achilles heel seems to be that he\u2019s a little too fond of chewing up the scenery longer than he really needs to\u2014which makes the pacing a little weird in the middle.",

Balances the humor and super emotional character moments really well, and the soundtrack definitely helped with that (standout: Slip Away by Perfume Genius).\n\nSpoilers: GIGI. Give this woman her own movie. Also, the Cardi B and not-really-cocaine moments were iconic. The hookup scene was def an L, but also pretty funny, so that works ig. Felt really bad for the panda, and Lisa Kudrow being Lisa Kudrow was great. I guess the kid with the car (idr his name) was kinda annoying, and Hope was forgettable ish (her relationship w/ Amy was not set up AT ALL, and she had no character except for being a sarcastic girl who\u2019s actually nice on the inside.

So there\u2019s nazis and flags and stuff, and it\u2019s a very nice hero\u2019s journey to set up the Avengers.",

    "review": "As a bit of a skeptic towards romances, the fact that this movie actually impressed me is a pretty solid testament to its quality. Of course, putting Cate Blanchett in a title role isn\u2019t ever going to hurt your film, but the electric chemistry between her character and Rooney Mara\u2019s Therese, the captivating story, and the melancholic score all come together to form a wholly engaging experience. \n\nGiven that Carol comes off as confident and refined past what any actual person would be like, Therese seems to be the character the audience is expected to relate the most to. Her most prominent character struggle is one of what she wants for herself versus what others (her boyfriend, her colleagues, Carol, society) want for her, which is definitely something almost everyone has faced on some level. The only problem is that that indecisiveness makes her a little bland and lacking in agency right up until the very end. We never really get to learn what makes her (or Carol) tick, since their most profound bonding moments are either really meaningful eye contact or chatting drowned out by music. We don\u2019t learn what draws Carol to Therese, which feels like a betrayal of how the movie constantly reminds us how hopelessly lost in love the two of them are. The actual relationship plays second fiddle to the characters\u2019 individual struggles, and I\u2019m fine with that, but not having your central romance hold up feels like a betrayal of your genre. All that said though, great movie, go watch it.",

It\u2019s black and white, but it doesn\u2019t seem too old, and it still captures the \u201cwar\u201d atmosphere that it no doubt was made in (1942 things). Rick (Humphrey Bogart) was a charismatic protagonist, and had great chemistry with Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman, who\u2019s fairy-like). There\u2019s great performances by Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and Sam (Dooley Wilson), with my personal favorite coming from Louis. I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of giving a win to a Nazi before, but this guy is hilarious (and, like, barely a nazi anyway). Rick\u2019s cafe is iconic, and this movie has straight up made Casablanca (the city) known. The plot is actually interesting too, and if you don\u2019t know the ending already, it\u2019s definitely something to look forward to. Good production value, too.",

Also Rick gets maturity points in the end for finding the right solution to the situation (also that one scene where he helped that one kid get money, perfect).

I\u2019m an Indian kid in university right now (off-campus, because pandemic) and I was super happy with my decision until I watched this movie - the spirit of Indian unis is so overpowering and familial that it\u2019s impossible not to yearn for that camaraderie. Maybe it\u2019s just me, since I\u2019m the target audience. The core message of this film is this: you\u2019re only a loser if you think you are, and fighting for yourself is all you can do - and it\u2019ll be enough. Just don\u2019t give up. And I think that\u2019s a message that can be appreciated by everyone. Throw in a cute love story between Anni (Sushant Singh Rajput, who\u2019s great, RIP) and Maya (Shraddha Kapoor, who I love) that\u2019s actually mature enough to be a lesson in and of itself, and an absolutely wonderful supporting cast - Derek (Tahir Basin), Acid (Naveen Polishetty), Mummy (Tushar Pandey), and Bevda (Saharsh Kumar Shukla) - to the greatness that is Sexa, and you have a comedy classic with insane amounts of heart that touches on important issues in society and portrays an authentic (well, mostly, come on) Indian college experience.",

I do wish they\u2019d given Maya more to do, but it was 2h30, so I understand having to cut out some parts. Still, replaying the doctor scenes wasn\u2019t too integral to the plot or pacing. Of course, the villain appreciating them in the end is a good moral ending, but I also would\u2019ve liked to see a more concrete ending for Anni and Maya\u2019s relationship. Apart from that, the end monologue was great. Oh also, there were basically no songs. Go figure. Anyway, it\u2019s great, and this proves that movies don\u2019t need songs to be good (@Bollywood).

Of course the use of racial profanity for alleged historical accuracy is still pretty uncomfortable for me, but the antagonists were also portrayed with some solid performances including Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Steven (Samuel L Jackson). Broomhilda\u2019s (Kerry Washington) metaphoric connection to the Poetic Edda was cool, and I think Django\u2019s arc was just really satisfying in the end.

I\u2019m serious, if it was possible to have a director win one of these, I would absolutely give Villeneuve first place without hesitation. Acting was pretty great across the board, but there weren\u2019t particular standout performances.

Obviously, this movie isn\u2019t perfect, with Mycroft (Sam Claflin) being completely intolerable for the first half, and Sherlock (Henry Cavill) being completely watered down (especially after watching the BBC Sherlock). But otherwise, Enola was likeable, and she had great chemistry with Lord Tewksbury (Louis Partridge). A supporting cast of Helena Bonham Carter as the mom and Fiona Shaw was fun, staying true to the British theme of the cast. The story itself wasn\u2019t bad, if a little disjointed, but the moral was extremely relevant to 2020\u2019s audience (what with all the protests and human rights campaigns), and it was pulled off well.",

Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine had great chemistry; I didn\u2019t know Jim Carrey was a good dramatic actor, but I do now. There\u2019s a massive supporting cast here, too, with Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Mary (Kirsten Dunst), Patrick (Elijah Wood), Rob (David Cross), and Howard (Tom Wilkinson), and their exciting little characters all help compensate for the lack of action for the leads. That said, the memory jumping structure and direction was outstanding and unique, if a little jarring, and the cuts really helped the pacing of the movie. A lot of the dialogue was great (Nietzsche quotes) and Patrick\u2019s manipulation of the memory-wipe system is also super important in terms of speculative science fiction. Still, Clementine\u2019s Manic Pixie Dream Girl persona shines through and her bright hair and clothes definitely contrast well with Joel\u2019s. There\u2019s some comedy there, lots of drama, and a compelling romance. Definitely an interesting romance movie.",

The idea and the execution is definitely very professional and well-researched, creating the uncomfortable mood that would no doubt surround any ordeal of that sort - this helps keep tension, but it\u2019s also hard to watch. The direction, music, cinematography, dialogue is all great, and I think Ava is definitely an interesting take on an inorganic human.

There\u2019s a lot of different tones in the movie, but they never feel disjointed. Of course, the soundtrack is legendary, featuring songs by the Beatles and even the Star Wars Theme. The movie\u2019s representation of peak 1900s culture is so good that if I had to show aliens one movie to give them an impression of humans it would be this. Ferris Bueller\u2019s effortless charm and wit makes him possibly the most likeable character of all time - certainly in my book. Mia Sara\u2019s Sloane is insanely good looking and has a sophisticated grace that makes her character so much more than just a supporting role. Of course, Cameron was the heart of the movie, and his relationship with the Ferrari was both hilarious and fabulous character growth. Gene\u2019s character growth was also immensely satisfying, as was Rooney\u2019s ultimate downfall. This will forever be my go-to movie.",

Overall, the animation is pretty good, and the music and narration are the cornerstones of what makes the episodes so heartfelt. The first part will make you hungry with all that noodle talk, but it shows how much affect you might have on the lives of people you don\u2019t even know. The second part is probably for more mature-minded viewers, having to do with self-realization. Yi Lin (Minako Kotobuki) and Lulu (Jona Xiao) have a really touching sibling relationship as adults, which isn\u2019t depicted too often.

The subtle musical and theatrical expertise of the crew make this movie what it is, with the narrative style and the opening and closing shots adding an artistic edge to an already thematically sound film.

Anna\u2019s plot wasn\u2019t as refined as it was in the first one, but her song at the end of the movie more than made up for it. Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven were decent comedy aids, keeping the tempo of a generally somber movie relatively upbeat, while managing to not disrupt its tone. The main issue with this film, though, was pacing. The movie spends most of its time setting up its character conflicts instead of developing them, so the ending is forced to tie everything together with a neat little bow. Frozen II\u2019s final half hour or so felt a bit disjoint from the rest of the movie because of that.",

    "review": "Probably the best one out of the 8 movies, if it\u2019s possible to rank them. This one utilizes Harry\u2019s backstory to the absolute maximum, bringing back characters with such an emotional stake in his life that the plot actually seems like it might affect his development. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson) were hitting their stride as actors in this movie, Daniel in particular, and I think Draco (Tom Felton) played a really important comedic role. The adults were obviously more prolific; Michael Gambon\u2019s Dumbledore was probably at his best in his debut here, while Snape (Alan Rickman), Sirius (Gary Oldman), and Remus were all phenomenal near the end. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and Buckbeak\u2019s storyline wasn\u2019t the most exciting, but it worked really well with the plot in the end. The DADA class remains one of the best scenes overall, and of course the Patronus scene was probably the most iconic Harry Potter scene ever.",

    "spoilerReview": "Well everyone\u2019s already seen this, but I\u2019m sure the twist with Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) being Scabbers and the real traitor was pretty shocking at the time. The reunion between Sirius and Remus is great to watch, as are both of their reactions to Harry (recognizing his eyes, etc.). I think the Marauders storyline is one of the absolute best parts of Harry Potter, and this movie utilizes it the most out of any of them. Hogsmeade, the Marauders\u2019 Map, everything was pretty well done. Ron was pretty annoying in this one though, even if that scene with them eating the beans was cool. Marge was awful (rightly so) and the Knight Bus scene was pretty random, I guess. Dementors were definitely on point.",

Then there\u2019s Hotaru (Ayane Sakura) who grows up from a six year-old to a high school student, and her journey in this short movie is almost as tragic as Gin\u2019s. They do have a pretty heartwarming relationship, but the animation, music, narration, and supporting characters really do help to build a world that supports their story and seems authentic. The last scene is honestly really sad, but felt inevitable, and there are a lot of beautiful shots in the movie. I feel like it might be an allegory for children and their imagination, but I\u2019m not sure how the ending would factor into that. Still, it was definitely great value for time, and I think it\u2019s worth a recommend.",

Suliman used the war as an excuse to fight all other wizards, including Howl, who rejected her teachings and became a half-demon with the help of Calcifer (also a legend). They fight a lot, and Suliman tricks the Witch of the Waste and steals her power. More fighting, more drama, until eventually Sophie kisses the turnip and his curse is lifted, ending the war. Pretty random way to go about it. Howl I guess has a character arc, which is nice. Markl, the kid, is pretty much just there, though his dynamic with Sophie is pretty cute to watch. The witch gets annoying near the end. The whole aging business is super motif-like, which I guess is cool. Still hella confusing.",

There\u2019s a lot of heart in this movie, and I enjoyed the little insertions of Spanish here and there in the dialogue.

A supporting cast of Bill Pullman, Randy Quaid as the legend himself, and Margaret Colin as Connie all give great dramatic performances in the tense atmosphere that this movie thrives on. The start is definitely slow, the second act has its gems, but the third act of this movie is one of the best third acts you\u2019ll see in action movies.

Tarantino\u2019s reinvention of history is really entertaining, especially with the characters of Hans Lamda and Brad Pitt\u2019s Aldo Raine, both of whose unique characters are insanely entertaining to watch. The length of this movie is an issue, as it is with most Tarantino movies, taking out some of the urgency from the story. Otherwise, the opening was constructed beautifully, and the character introductions were iconic. The cast was certainly impressive; Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender, Diane Kruger, Melanie Laurent, Daniel Bruhl. The portrayal of Hitler is also pretty hilarious to watch, and is very much in tone with the rest of the movie\u2019s theme - the cinemafiction of one of the biggest tragedies in human history (WWII).",

The premise is solid, and the visuals and score are on another level. The movie plays with different aspects of humanity, celebrating our legacy as pioneers and our capacity for love while looking down on our drive for individual self-preservation and fear of the unknown. The chemistry between McConaughey\u2019s character and his daughter is played to its fullest, and their connection is a focal point for the entire movie.

There are probably more iconic or critically acclaimed examples out there, but everything about this set piece is just amazing. From the nerve-wracking score to the constant cutting between everything going around to the exceptional performances from literally everyone, I can never take my eyes off the screen when this part is on.\n\nOn another note, I totally get the criticisms of how the third act tried to be too brilliant for its own good. I find myself having to explain the tesseract scene to basically everyone I watch this movie with, which is fair, since I spent an hour or so reading about it after I first saw it in theaters. But hey\u2014this is a Nolan movie, after all, and that pitfall was completely to be expected.\n\nSeeing Murph on her deathbed hit different. I don't know what to say. The words \"No parent should have to watch their own child die\" left me feeling devastated at all the years she and Cooper should've been able to spend together as father and daughter that she'd had to live out on her own.",

This movie has that too, just to a lesser precedent. The emotional quotient was kept high throughout, with solid acting from Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, and Alex Wolff, while the action is handled by Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan, leaving the comedy to Kevin Hart and Jack Black. Suffice to say, the cast speaks for itself in terms of competence, and they definitely have chemistry too, with everyone doing what they were expected to, and also working a little outside of their comfort zones. The world was also enhanced from the previous movie, while not seeming much like a ret-con, which was also a welcome addition to the story and continuity of the movies.

As someone who hasn\u2019t ever seen any one of the original Jurassic Park movies from start to finish, but still has a general idea of the iconic scenes, this was perfect for me. Definitely makes sense that this is the 6th highest grossing movie ever, and I think it did justice to the originals. The cast is loaded, with Chris Pratt (Owen) and Bryce Dallas Howard (Claire) leading the movie as adults (with pretty great chemistry and dialogue) and Ty Simpkins (Gray) and Nick Robinson (Zack) playing the child-self-insert characters that visit the resort. Vincent D\u2019Onofrio, Irrfan Khan, Katie McGrath, Judy Greer, etc. make a pretty stellar supporting cast too. The visual experience was awesome, and the colors made the park seem like a lot more than just a CGI paradise. The dinosaurs were cool, and the park was impressive. Giacchino\u2019s score was pretty beautiful, and it took from the original Jurassic Park theme (if it ain\u2019t broke) too, so best of both worlds. The plotlines make a lot of sense, and none of the characters seem unjustified in their actions, which is a refreshing surprise for a blockbuster. The action also really doesn\u2019t disappoint. The acting is great, and the relationships between the brothers, the adults, and Claire and the kids have a lot of heart too, which keeps the stakes high.

    "review": "I feel like this movie gets way less credit than it deserves. I understand that the original was super iconic to some people, but there\u2019s a distinct difference between the two movies (even if the plot itself was starkly similar) - The first was about visiting oriental culture in the west, while this one was about a westerner dealing with chinese culture IN china. There\u2019s a difference. Oh, and the other one was actually Karate and Japan/Okinawa. Still, both are great. Jaden smith was a pretty loveable protagonist, and his chemistry with both Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) and his mom (Taraji P Henson) was great. Wenwen Han was cute as Meiying, and the exploration of cultural divide and assimilation was great to view from a kid\u2019s eyes. I actually loved how nice this movie was to China - even the opening credits were in Chinese, which I found really cool. The music, score, and everything was phenomenal, the cinematography and establishing shots were great, and there was a lot of emotional weight in the main character\u2019s arc, which is what made the final scene so great. Anyway, it\u2019s a fun watch for kids, and definitely helps capture the experience of overcoming challenges as a kid.",

For a two-hour movie, it didn\u2019t ever feel overly boring, but I guess that\u2019s the plus point of detective stories. Christopher Plummer\u2019s Harlan Thrombey started the film out on a really sincere note, and his chemistry with Ana was pretty good to watch. Chris and Ana also carried the middle section of the movie, while Craig held all of it together. There\u2019s enough comedy in it to keep the movie from getting too stale, even if some of it is rather tasteless, but the tone of the film is the real hero, keeping it light hearted through the color palette and dialogue.",

The ending wasn\u2019t bad, but it wasn\u2019t exactly revolutionary either. Definitely a lot of heart though, and it was great to see Marta (de Armas) come into her own. While the specifics of how may have been a mystery, though, it felt inevitable from the start that she\u2019d come out on top. Overall, I think it is a good watch, especially in recent years, since it fits in with the anti-money-grab message that needs to be heard at the moment.",

Jack Black is always fun to watch, and he carries the movie well, and a generally solid plot and entertaining visuals places this really high by default. The comedy does get taken a bit too far at times, not in the offensive sense, but just a bit annoying at times. The color palette was pretty bland throughout as well, and for an animated film, it definitely could have used a little more lively colors.",

But then I saw Tom Cruise in the cast, and I thought, huh, \u201cwhy not?\u201d Turns out it\u2019s pretty interesting. 80s movies were just something else. Mia Sara (Lily) and Tom Cruise (Jack) are both really pretty in this one, but there isn\u2019t too much chemistry. It\u2019s not easy to have chemistry with Tom Cruise, so not a big deal. Supporting cast are better than you\u2019d think acting-wise, but VERY campy costumes. The first scene was pretty rightly terrifying and disgusting, if slightly campy, and the villain monologue was pretty impressive. Mia Sara\u2019s introduction was, of course, awesome - a fairy if I ever saw one. Adorable. The costumes and sets have a very Star Wars feel to them, which I\u2019m here for. Highkey the bad guy is the best character in the story. The bad guy\u2019s design is completely awful, but scary, and his voice is AWESOME.

Aimee (Jessica Henwick) is pretty cool, but both Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt) and Clyde (Michael Rooker) have more screentime than her, and are pretty funny. Watching Minnow and Joel interact is great.

And better yet, it somehow got me to appreciate the beauty of winter. There were moments in the movie when I could recognize imperfections, but it wasn\u2019t really the perfection of the movie that made it what it was. Its appreciation of the nature of humanity - from Itsuki (girl) stumbling around with her slippers at the beginning, to the classic childhood days that stay with us, to the importance of family, and the beauty of love. This isn\u2019t a love story, certainly, but its really an ode to life and nature. You never know what things you do will make a difference in others\u2019 lives - something as stupid as a doodle, a weird habit, or a song you like can become the reason relationships start or reignite. I didn\u2019t realize that Itsuki (girl) and Hiroko were both played by the same actress (Miho Nakayama), but I guess it really does mean a lot - she\u2019s asking herself to remember Itsuki (boy) who she will and has loved. There\u2019s no aspect of time with this movie. There\u2019s just memory, and I love it. The cinematography is great, the relationships are great, and of course, the mountain scene in the snow is phenomenal acting.

It\u2019s got the Zack Snyder, Scorsese-esque style and grit, but also has a plot and characters you want to follow.

The supporting cast of General Zod (Michael Shannon, who\u2019s a little intense here), Jor-El (Russell Crowe), and Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) definitely boosted the star power; I thought Superman\u2019s parents (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) were probably the best performances too, and they would have got the win if they\u2019d had a little more effect on the plot. Still, this movie tells a new, captivating story that explores themes of loyalty, choice vs fate, conservatism vs trust - it\u2019s not easy. They pull it off remarkably well, and they set up a cinematic universe at the same time. Great job, overall.

Christopher Reeves would have said the same. The last fight against Zod may have gotten a little out of hand, but the climax where Clark yells after killing him is really powerful. The story treats the whole \u2018superhero\u2019 concept very seriously and somehow manages to pull it off relatively well, all things considered. The world engine scene and even the destruction of Krypton were super powerful, but my favourite from this movie would be the one where Jonathan Kent dies and Clark\u2019s watching, knowing he could have stopped it. That really sums up his whole struggle, and it\u2019s awesome that they went through with that Uncle Ben-type moment.",

    "review": "So this movie was really hard to classify, especially given that I have a lot of exposure to the original. Still, it wasn\u2019t really an action movie, but it wasn\u2019t comedy either. It felt most like a war movie in the middle, and there was definitely an element of hollywood magic when it came to the relationship between Mulan and Xianniang (Gong Li, who does a great job here). The ensemble cast for this movie was really impressive: Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Tzi Ma. Overall, it wasn\u2019t bad by any means, it just wasn\u2019t as consistently engaging as one would have expected from a disney movie plot. That said, it\u2019s important to recognize that they emphasized the reality of the movie\u2019s themes, at the expense of iconic characters and songs, which may leave a bad taste in some of our mouths. Still, the movie had heart, and even if it wasn\u2019t the most watchable, it didn\u2019t underperform drastically at any point. Yifei is also incredibly cute whenever she smiles, so take that as you will.",

A cast of Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, Luke Evans, Gemma Arterton (etc.) make it pretty entertaining throughout. And although the movie\u2019s structure mocks that of classic murder mysteries, it does suffer (ironically) from some of the same cliches. But the chemistry between Aniston and Sandler, and the abundance of non-forced funny moments more than makes up for any kind of unoriginality in the plot.

The sister dynamic between Satsuki and Mei (Chika Sakamoto) is pretty cute and makes up most of the movie. Takamoto and the Cat Bus are pretty cool but also the Cat Bus scares the hell out of me and Takamoto looks pretty weird. Also the \u2018plot\u2019 of the whole movie is a little meh, since it\u2019s just them chilling for most of it.

Quentin is relatable in a natural, authentic sense, and Margo (Cara Delevingne) is a manic-pixie-dream-girl, but it\u2019s okay because the message of the movie is that no one is actually as one dimensional as they are in the minds of others. The real heart of this movie is Quentin\u2019s pining for Margo, his chemistry with Radar (Justice Smith) and Ben (Austin Abrams), and the upbeat tone and shenanigans that they actually get up to while trying to find Margo. Lacey (Halston Sage) was cool too, and did shake up the whole standard clique-bashing in these kinds of movies. I watched this soon after high school, so it did hit me in the feels quite a bit, but I think the authenticity of this movie will get through to anyone who watches.

The ending scene wasn\u2019t the perfecting ending Quentin wanted, but I think it might have struck home a little harder with some better delivery from Margo - Delevingne did a great job in the first part of the movie, though. The outro scenes were satisfying, and it was generally the bittersweet ending I\u2019d come to expect from such a movie, but it\u2019s good to see that Quentin grows over the course of the plot.",

I\u2019m not typically a dark, grimy realism movie kinda guy, but Bong Joonho definitely knew what he was doing (and has the bag to show for it). I can\u2019t guarantee that everyone will like it, but I can assure you that you won\u2019t be bored watching\u2026 one way or another. The plot, the sets, the dialogue, the characters all scream for your attention continuously, and the pacing keeps the suspense real until the very end. The cast is extremely versatile, from the expressive Mrs Park (Cho Yeojeong, who\u2019s just beautiful) and classist Mr. Park (Lee Sungyun), to Ki-Jung - who\u2019s just the funniest and most likeable - to the crafty Mr. Kim (Song Kangho), the loud Mrs. Kim (Jang Hyejin), and the relatable Ki-Woo (Choi Woosik). The supporting cast of Dahye (Jeong Jiso) and Dasong (Jeong Hyunjoong) as comedic sides and Moongwang (Lee Jeongeun) with Geunse (Park Myunghoon) as dramatic sides worked really well to keep the balance as well. The gritty tone somehow managed to persist through the comedic moments, and there was always a sense of mystery that kept me interested.",

Anyway, the movie held together the tension pretty well throughout, with the third act basically just ending like a Shakespearean tragedy (with a little promise at the end). So yeah, that house was awesome. Shots were wonderful. Acting was great. The scene with them all drinking in the living room is also one of my favourites (Ki-Jung is hilarious). There\u2019s an authentic family feeling to the characters, even with all the crazy things they go through. Ki-Jung\u2019s death didn\u2019t really hit as hard as I would\u2019ve hoped, but the morse code thing and the smell motifs were both utilized to good effect.",

The standout scenes from this movie would probably be the capture the flag fight at camp, and then the Vegas Poker Face montage. Brandon T. Jackson was pretty funny in what was an otherwise more expository type of movie, with even super talented cast members (Sean Bean, Pierce Brosnan) being underwhelming. Rosario Dawson\u2019s Persephone was pretty random, but it was funny nonetheless. The villains in this movie were the main issue, with Luke being pretty much a million times worse as a villain than as a hero. Seemed like the movie might have been able to benefit from a little more budget, but it was still rewatchable if only for the nostalgia of Riordan\u2019s books.",

Depp\u2019s Captain Jack is still awesome, supported by a great cast of Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander), Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Then the supporting characters like Gibbs (Kevin McNally), Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel and Ragetti, Mullroy and Murtogg, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), and James Norrington (Jack Davenport) are also iconic. The introduction of Singapore and Sao Feng\u2019s (Chow Yunfat) crew was really cool leading up to the Brethren Court, which I just wholly enjoyed.

But yeah, Barbossa was almost as wonderful as Jack, their dialogue is actually really meaningful, and the resolution to the arc was all pretty good - it made us like Will more than we would have otherwise. Beckett was a really annoying person, but we love to hate him, even when he\u2019s bullying Davy Jones. Elizabeth is also just a badass in this one.

There\u2019s a quirky mix of characters with Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), Jesse (Skylar Astin), etc. before quirky became obnoxious. The riff-off scene is iconic, and the song choices are pretty cool for me since early 2010s pop is really my default genre of music. The romance between Beca and Jesse is okay - a little underdeveloped - but the camaraderie within the Bellas is much more prominent and central to the story. It follows the romcom template, except instead of a guy, Beca has relationship issues with her friends. That\u2019s basically it. And the last song medley is quite great too.",

Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) is definitely a likeable protagonist, and the initial scene does a great job of introducing her, her father (Daniel Dae Kim), and the cutest ever baby armadillo-looking-thing Tuk Tuk (Alan Tudyk). Big props to the animators for that. I\u2019m usually not too into Awkwafina\u2019s humour, but her quips are pretty funny coupled with Raya\u2019s more badass personality. Then there\u2019s Namari (Gemma Chan, who\u2019s beautiful) who does have good chemistry with Raya - their little slang that the creators made up (binturi, dep la, etc.) was really cool and brought a new level to their dynamic, especially since they\u2019re based on real languages. The supporting cast of Raya\u2019s friends are pretty funny too, but the visuals and the music do some REALLY heavy lifting, especially near the end, and got me in the feels.

That, and his camaraderie with his gamer friends - especially Artemis - gave the movie a lot of heart. The ways that they solved the challenges were cool, and cameos from Simon Pegg as Ogden, Hannah John-Kamen as F\u2019Nale and Mark Rylance as Halliday helped give the movie a solid acting backbone. My personal favorite was Artemis - she was a real strong female character without any of the cliches that are usually attached to that mold. Overall, this movie is basically nerd paradise - making pop-culture the center of the universe is the dream. It\u2019s got a lot of emotion and is enjoyable, and made well.

The Samantha birthmark thing was cool, and Wade\u2019s aunt and uncle did die, so there are a few loose ends that were kinda glossed over. H (Lena Waithe) as a big dude was pretty funny too.",

Anil Kapoor and Irrfan Khan did decent jobs as veteran actors in their respective roles too, considering they were effectively acting in a second language. The story itself is really great, and keeps the suspense building in a way that keeps the drama, fulfills some happiness for the audience and characters, but doesn\u2019t break the \u201crealism\u201d that\u2019s been established as the USP of this movie. Of course, Jamal, Salim, and Latika\u2019s stories as orphans or \u201cslumdogs\u201d and their suffering might be portrayed in a manner that might seem completely unimaginable and detached from most western viewers, but such a story is seldom out of the public eye in developing countries - it\u2019s good to see that they\u2019re being recognized and elevated to a larger global audience.",

My favourite was probably the whole \u20183 Musketeers\u2019 motif that was going on - made the last scene super powerful. But also Jamal having the brain to realize that Prem, the host, was lying to him was definitely a power move (because a liar definitely knows a liar). But yeah, I like how Jamal never gives up on Latika. On paper, Salim\u2019s character is so complex and messed up that it would be the best, but I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d feel about him if I was Jamal.

Knowing that something similar to this happened in real life is only that much more impactful, and she pulls off the tragic helplessness brilliantly. The direction is actually amazing too - I usually like bright colours in a movie, but the filter that they put on the camera really fits the royal palette. The costumes are great, especially the one with the veil. Of course, the subject matter can be really really heavy, which is part of what makes this movie so important, but you also can\u2019t rewatch too often. The bulimia scenes and the mass eating were both heartbreaking. The scenes with Diana and the kids are particularly endearing, and Maggie (Sally Hawkins) is a welcome surprise in the third act. The Anne Boleyn comparisons are interesting, but went a little over my head. Jack Farthing\u2019s Charles is just so annoying, which means he\u2019s probably about right. The end scene is really nice to watch, and I love how at peace she is - saying Spencer and taking back whatever ground she can is definitely really meaningful.

In trying to be a perfect conclusion, No Way Home sometimes forgets to be a movie with any sort of meaning behind it\u2014as in Endgame, the jokes, callbacks, and \u201cnow clap\u201d moments tend to stifle the actual tension and emotion in the film\u2019s own story. It\u2019s great to see for the first time, but it just doesn\u2019t have the kind of staying power that I\u2019d hoped for.",

The relationship between Haku and Chiriho (Rumi Hiiragi) is really cute, and Lin (Yumi Tamai) is a pretty good complement to Chiriho too. And as great as the story is, the animation and the music of this movie are just in another world. First, every one of Haku\u2019s scenes is wonderful cuz the guy just looks awesome. The setting and buildup are all great too, animation-wise. But THE MUSIC. The main piano theme for this movie is the BEST PIANO I have heard in my entire life. So if anything, just listen to that.

Marlon Brando as Jor-El and Jene Hackman as Lex Luthor were decent cameos, even if Lex was a little more comical than I would have expected, because of his henchmen. The pacing of the plot was pretty offputting, but they did explain Clark\u2019s origin in the most complete way, so new watchers won\u2019t miss out.

The scenes with the animal transformations are cool, and the squirrel scenes were especially funny - I had to give that crying squirrel the win, come on. That was precious. But yeah, Merlin (Karl Swenson) and Archimedes (Junius Matthews) had really funny banter throughout, and Arthur (Rickie Sorensen) was the perfect wide-eyed representative of the audience.

RV (Saif Ali Khan) and Radhika (Rani Mukherji) go from being confused young adults to struggling parents to finally getting their act together, and we get to see their whole journey. With princess (Angelina Indani) narrating, and the cute scenes featuring her and Champ (Ali Haji), their family dynamic is really wholesome and endearing. The second act of the movie does explore a lot of the struggles that Indian expats go through when they emigrate to the US, and showcases the trademark camaraderie that we\u2019re so proud of. The friendship between RV and Harry (Javid Jaffrey), whose accent is virtually incomprehensible, but he\u2019s hilarious, is one of the best parts of the movie. And of course, the songs and the racing. Almost all the songs and even the score are iconic to me, and the three races that they show are all really cool. RV\u2019s struggles were devastating to watch as a kid, but the final race really made up for everything. Also Sasha was just so funny in her limited screen time that I had to give her the win, but Princess would probably have got it otherwise (her hairstyle is half of a win alone).",

So yeah, Tenet. Not gonna lie, didn\u2019t understand everything (mostly because the version of the movie I saw wasn\u2019t exactly the clearest), so I\u2019m going to have to rewatch, just like everyone else who saw it the first time. That said, I did understand the plot, characters, score, etc. and they were all Nolan-esque as ever. I\u2019d never heard of John David Washington before this role, but he\u2019s actually a lot different from what I expected - in a good way. He comes off as likeable from the start, but still a kind of underdog. He\u2019s got great chemistry with Neil (Robert Pattinson, who has redeemed himself as a great actor) and Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), both of whom could just as easily have been winners. Pattinson\u2019s character always seems out of place throughout the story, and watching his arc unfold at the end of the movie is great to see. Kat and Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) have an interesting relationship too, providing most of the heavy-duty acting to the film. Supporting cast of Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Clemence Poesy, Michael Caine, Martin Donovan and Dimple Kapadia doesn\u2019t hurt either. Of course, the score was great, loud in just the right places, though I think I wasn\u2019t able to appreciate it to its utmost on first viewing. Otherwise, Nolan\u2019s idea is once again entertaining as hell, pseudo-science to the core, and a must-watch for people who want a little confusion in their lives.",
    "reviewDate": "2024-01-15",

The backwards bullets and all the scenes with the reverse shots - especially the ones where some people are inverted and others aren\u2019t - are PHENOMENAL and look like they would be SUPER hard to film, so kudos. Neil having been from the future was definitely a good twist - even if time-travel veterans might think it obvious, it was done in a way that still made it valuable. Then the end scene with Kat diving off the boat was great too. Just Nolan things, you know? And of course the I AM THE PROTAGONIST scene was hella satisfying to watch.",

It had everything that the first had (except maybe romance, which wasn\u2019t a big deal) and it did it all better, and MORE. Super fun, for sure. The acting was great here too: Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) was again the best dramatic actor here, but Edward Furlong was actually great as John, both in comedic and dramatic scenes - his chemistry with Arnold was amazing. T-800 was great this time around, and Arnold did an even better job with his visual acting. His stale delivery is the only thing that stopped me from giving him the win, even if he gave us some really iconic lines in this one too. Supporting cast of Robert Patrick and Joe Morton, as T-1000 and Miles Dyson respectively, were both great too - T-1000 is straight up the stuff of nightmares, and Patrick is great in the role. Villains are unexpectedly great in this movie. So yeah, definitely a great action movie. If you liked the first one, or Die Hard and stuff, this is for you. Also the costumes in this one are to die for - whoever thought up the iconic Sarah Connor vest is a legend.",
    "reviewDate": "2024-01-15",
    "spoilerReview": "So yeah that end scene was pretty emotional, with T-800 dying. Making John a senator was a bit strange, but I get the message they were trying to offer in the end. Honestly Miles could have been MVP, since the dude was literally just a smart guy who ALSO cared about his family and was willing to sacrifice his work for the greater good. Everyone acted so well in this movie that it was that close, but the main cast definitely deserve recognition, and I chose Furlong since kid actors are hardly ever this good. The set piece at the end was the best, and I felt like the chase scene at the start wasn\u2019t as fun as I hoped it would be. Sarah\u2019s recurring visions were a little strange, and maybe her hospital time was a little much, but the break-out scene was SO satisfying. Also WHAT THE HELL is this movie\u2019s deal with LICKING PEOPLE? Happened a whole TWO times, and it was just glossed over. So yeah apart from that, pretty solid.",

The keystone of the MCU, and its first real world-banging movie, it\u2019s really not hard to see why everyone loves this film. Even after having watched it dozens of times, its charm was still intact, mostly thanks to great acting from the whole cast (RDJ, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, ScarJo, Jeremy Renner, Sam Jackson, Tom Hiddleston), but my latest rewatch shed light on Mark Ruffalo\u2019s Bruce Banner, who comes in at a close second winner for this movie - although he does get overshone by a lot of other characters, his character and his part in the story are played beautifully. Hiddleston\u2019s Loki is easily one of the most memorable villains in the superhero genre, with the British class really shining through, particularly in his conversation with Black Widow. Admittedly, the first act did not shine as much as the rest of the movie, with the second act grasping the audience\u2019s attention and the third\u2026 well, the Avengers\u2019 third act stands as one of the best third acts in action movie history (for me, anyway). The chemistry is certainly there, and Stark\u2019s dialogue keeps things interesting even when the plot is moving slowly. Perhaps if the first act had been shorter, and the first scene omitted, bringing the runtime down to about 2 hours as opposed to 2.5, this movie would score even higher. However, this is made up tenfold by its sheer rewatchability - owing partly to Alan Silvestri\u2019s unspeakably iconic score.",

The supporting cast of Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and Nikabrik (Warwick Davis) along with Aslan (Liam Neeson) is definitely formidable, but Caspian\u2019s charm and compelling story steals the show. It\u2019s definitely hard to sway the audience away from their favourite heroes, but this movie manages it quite well. You can just tell that Peter and Susan don\u2019t quite believe in Narnia\u2019s magic as they used to, and their arcs are completed perfectly by the ending, as is Caspian\u2019s.

As an adventure film (treasure-hunting type), it\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen, taking inspiration from all kinds of history and mythology. The cast is pretty great, with Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing, and Paul Bettany as Silas (who was great from an acting perspective). Jean Reno and Alfred Molina played good supporting roles, and Audrey Tatou is officially the best looking french person I know. Her chemistry with Hanks is great, and it\u2019s definitely fun to watch her hold her own beside such a talented actor. In terms of the movie\u2019s rewatchability, I\u2019m not sure, since I\u2019ve only seen it the one time, but that\u2019s the thing about adventure movies - the twists are great the first time around, less so after. But I can tell that the author really did think the plot through wonderfully, giving all the characters reasonable motivations. Music was really good, the cinematography was fun to watch since they were in France and London. And despite all the possible blasphemy of the film, its moral does hold up regardless of the beliefs of the viewer.",

It\u2019s got a tragic love story, two charming young characters with great chemistry, lots of cancer, parent issues, and some death. The imagery that the movie tries to represent is really what makes it special, and it highlights how idealistic teens can really be - it discusses the positives and negatives from this hopefulness in a way that\u2019s really nice to watch. And the characters are hella cute. Obviously, Augustus Waters is an absolute legend, but his chemistry with Shailene Woodley\u2019s Hazel Grace made most of the movie. Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, and Willem Dafoe all put in powerful supporting performances, and overall it was a great emotional journey to go on.",

This one goes out to all those kids who had a crush on that one teacher in school, or on that one adult who saw you as a kid. I feel like I can\u2019t do it justice by explaining it, but the chemistry between Yukino and Takao (Miyu Irino) is so authentic and relatable that you start to root for them even though there\u2019s 12 years of an age difference and he\u2019s a minor (the movie is fully legal though, don\u2019t worry). But yeah, the music, the animation, the characters, the motifs\u2026 Shinkai just knocks it all out of the park.

The reveal that she was a teacher did surprise me, but I guess it did make sense. The whole \u2018tanka\u2019 poem callback from her being a English Literature teacher was really beautiful too, fitting in with the whole \u2018garden\u2019 aspect of the movie. And it\u2019s just so funny to watch a teacher and a kid talk about drinking in the morning while they skip school. But yeah, that last scene when Takao is yelling at her and she\u2019s crying\u2026 fabulous. And the post credits of him leaving the shoes for her in the park was a great ending too. Solid. Would definitely watch a longer version.",

Keira Knightley is also great, though it would\u2019ve been nice if her character had had more to do. Then again, this movie is set during World War II, so I can see how the filmmakers struggled with that. The score is great, and was actually nominated for an Oscar before losing out to another score by the same composer, which kind of says all that needs to be said. The movie overall is ALL ABOUT THE SECRETS (makes sense), and as such can get pretty depressing despite a reasonable amount of levity. Turing\u2019s sexuality is handled pretty well, if not completely accurately. To be honest, most of this movie took a few liberties with regard to history, but it all works to make the film better, so I\u2019ll allow it. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a Game of Thrones actor in there somewhere too.",

Of course, the supporting cast of Lucius/Frozone (Samuel L Jackson, who\u2019s amazing as usual), Syndrome (Jason Lee, who\u2019s actually a well-crafted villain), and Edna (absolute scene-stealer) are just gems of performances too.

For an animated movie, the performances were also unbelievable, making it almost impossible for me to pick a winner. Between Jeremy Irons\u2019 Scar - one of the most Shakespearian villains of all time - Rowan Atkinson\u2019s Zazu, John Kani\u2019s Rafiki, Matthew Broderick\u2019s Adult Simba, and Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella\u2019s Timon and Pumbaa, there were almost no non-iconic characters in the film. Given that it was based off of Hamlet, it isn\u2019t all that surprising that the film\u2019s plot is well crafted and meaningful, but it is also masterfully complemented with some of the most tasteful songs in cinema history, perfectly capturing the characters\u2019 moods and themes as the film progressed (\u201cI Just Can\u2019t Wait to Be King\u201d, \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d, \u201cCan You Feel The Love Tonight\u201d).

Ariel is pretty impulsive and easy to fall in love, but apart from that she\u2019s a likeable protagonist, and the way she\u2019s animated is really iconic. Jodi Benson\u2019s voice is just so amazing as well, and Part of Your World is such a dreamy song that most kids can relate to. King Triton (Kenneth Mars) is actually a good parent throughout, and Sebastian plays the Mushu role of escorting the protagonist through the plot with lots of comic relief. Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes) is super handsome, and his character isn\u2019t bad, having been fixated on finding the owner of Ariel\u2019s beautiful voice. I\u2019m a huge fan of his butler Grimsby (Ben Wright) also.

Now Ursula (Pat Carroll) obviously didn\u2019t have the clearest motivations, but she was definitely really scary and her voice + design were both on point. Her turning into a massive monster and getting impaled by a ship was pretty stupid though. Also having Eric kill her seems undeserved, but I guess Ariel was a little indisposed. The mind-control voice stuff was pretty unnecessary I think, and it would have just been better to have Eric WANT to marry the person with that voice. Also Triton swapping in for Ariel was a really nice scene, just like the ending where she gets legs again.",

A stellar cast of Mackenzie Foy, Rachel McAdams, Jeff Bridges, Marion Cotillard, James Franco, Ricky Gervias, Paul Rudd, and Benecio del Toro should be enough to get you to watch any film - and the animation doesn\u2019t take away from the emotion. The portrayal of contemporary education is hurtfully realistic, and the theme that children should be encouraged to facilitate their imaginations is both beautiful in planning and execution. The friendship between the little girl and the aviator can inspire emotion in even the most stone-faced audiences, and as remarkable as their plotline is, the Little Prince himself takes the crown for me. His story and character perfectly portray the innocence and purity of childhood, and his idealism will make everyone wish that they\u2019d taken just a little longer to grow up.

The action scenes were iconic in genuine matrix style, but they were a little too long for my taste as well, and shorter fights would have made for better pacing and lesser runtime, both of which would be the main areas of improvement here. Still, the plot was catchy and interesting, and definitely keeps you on your toes. Acting-wise, I can\u2019t decide if everyone was good or okay, but Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) and Trinity all did great with the dialogue they were given. Costumes were also awesome as usual. Supporting acts from Smith (Hugo Weaving), Persephone (Monica Bellucci), and Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) were all fun and entertaining, while Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) provided some star power.

    "review": "As far as sci-fi thrillers go, this one is pretty definitive. It has the exact same flaws as its immediate predecessor (overall length, battles were too long, pacing) but has the X-factor of actually having an ending, which is always nice. A lot of character arcs are also fulfilled in this one, particularly for minor characters, which we love to see. Keanu Reeves is just as good as Neo, but once again I prefer Moss\u2019 acting style (they both lean toward less visual acting, but her performance seemed more lively) as a lead. Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) was unfortunately sidelined, while Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith) was awesome in this one. Monica Bellucci\u2019s Persephone was wasted, but Hugo Weaving probably played his best Smith in this iteration. So yeah, it\u2019s definitely a solid ending to the series, even if the finer details are hazy if you think about them too much.",

    "spoilerReview": "There\u2019s SO much Jesus imagery going on with Neo at the end. The final fight ends in a pretty weird way, since everyone just explodes - I didn\u2019t understand why Neo gave up and then Smith died. But the Oracle definitely pulled through in this one; great arc for her. I did really like both the surface scenes with Neo and Trinity as well as Niobe\u2019s driving, but the main fight in Zion was mostly chaos. Still, the bit with Mifune and the kid was great. There really are a lot of notable actors in this movie; I recognized two from the Power Rangers series alone, so make of that what you will. But yeah, the final compromise between Neo and the machines seems a little tentative, but it works as an end to his arc.",

The relationship between Moses and Ramses (Ralph Fiennes) was extremely powerful and was the emotional basis for the entire movie, and even though Set I (Patrick Stewart) was objectively ruthless, both his and Ramses\u2019 actions were understandable in their own twisted ways. The incorporation of Zipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer) to the plot as Moses\u2019 catalyst was great, as was the occasional shift to Miriam\u2019s (Sandra Bullock) point of view. Overall, the music was another highlight of the movie\u2014hebrew chanting is really nice to hear, and the \u201cdeliver us\u201d theme was actually great. Aaron\u2019s (Jeff Goldblum) arc wasn\u2019t bad, and was the most believable in my opinion, even if he was meant to be some kind of a bystander.

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to have issues with the plot, but I did feel that there was a lot of bona fide deus ex machina involved whenever he faced conflict.

Stephen King\u2019s story was incredibly nuanced in the way only a novel can be, and the inclusion of all sorts of worldly practices into the greater metaphor for their struggle makes the movie that much grander - it feels like \u201cno matter how bad you think it is, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And there\u2019s definitely a lot of pain in the movie, so it isn\u2019t exactly pleasant always, but you\u2019ll definitely feel reassured after watching.

The fact that the movie has the n word has aged extremely poorly (even if there was a reason for it, as I understand) and didn\u2019t help its judgement.

Weasel (Sylvester Stallone) and Blackguard (Pete Davidson) were also funny. Polkadot Man (David Dastmalchian) and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) were also funny, and I think Gunn figured out how to improve on characters like Flag and Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to better suit the plot.

T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was obviously the centerpiece of the movie, and even though his delivery was (iconically) robotic, his visual presence was terrifying enough to make him a great antagonist. Reese (Michael Biehn) and Sarah were pretty great protagonists overall, not wasting time or squandering suspense, but also retaining relevant character moments. I guess suspense is the main high point with this movie, in both the plot and the music. It was mostly fast paced, even if the beginning was a little drawn out.

    "review": "Best one out of the three, if my memory holds true. Easily the one with the best message. Somehow these movies use very real, relatable romantic things that kids do and mesh it well with a totally stylized version of high school in a functional way - that\u2019s what makes everything so attractive to audiences. Lara Jean (Lara Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo) are perfect representations of the target audience\u2019s high school ideal, and their relationship is well written in terms of dialogue. The plot was super promising upto the second act (which is rare for these kinds of movies) and the New York scenes were all actually the best. Of course, the fact that all the transitions have kpop is a massive plus for me. But the story was straightforward and incredibly believable, and even though I had hoped they had the guts to handle it a little bravely, I think I\u2019m satisfied with the ending. Peter\u2019s dad\u2019s scene at the end was well done, and justified the ending. Graduation scene did make me a little melancholy, not going to lie. Also, supporting cast is awesome, with Trevor (Ross Butler), Margot (Janel Parrish), and Chris (Madeleine Arthur), with Kitty taking home the win for being just the purest little sibling ever. I guess there\u2019s still a little high school left in me.",

There\u2019s a great overall acting job from the cast: Iceman (Val Kilmer), Goose (Anthony Edwards), Viper (Tom Skerritt), and Charlie (Kelly McGillis) were all perfect in their roles, and had great chemistry with Cruise. The outfits were awesome, and the 80s nuance was really cool to see. Dialogue was hella iconic and quotable, which made the interactions that much better.

Edward (Matt Lanter) looked surprisingly similar to Robert Pattinson, and even though I just know him as the voice of Anakin Skywalker in the CW animated series, he was really funny as Edward. Whoever wrote the dialogue is probably a fan of the real series/movies, and the final battle with Daro (Ken Jeong) is hilarious. The whole Team Edward vs Team Jacob bit is funny too, and Jacob (Chris Riggi) is utilized even better in this version. Very good vampire puns.",

No seriously, this is basically the Sony equivalent of Iron Man - the only thing that sets them apart is RDJ and color. That said, Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) was a fantastic villain, and his encounters with Eddie (Tom Hardy) were great. The highlight of the movie for me was when Venom and Eddie started talking to each other - instant gold. Annie (Michelle Williams) was a passable female lead, along with Jenny Slate, whose quirky vibe was good for keeping the start of the movie fresh, and the plot was pretty solid overall. The whole symbiote science system worked really well with the villain\u2019s ideals, and the Venom vs Riot fight at the end was great. Basically, any scene that actually included Venom was fabulous.

Plot, music, situation, all masterfully crafted; characters were iconic and well thought-out - Captain McCrea (Jeff Garlin) was particularly good, but the robots ruled this one. The animation and attention to detail regarding their facial expressions was what made the movie, alongside the sound mixing and effects (them saying each others\u2019 names is just adorable). There\u2019s drama, romance, heart, redemption, and a critique on humanity\u2019s gluttony and environmental indifference; all in all, I\u2019d be happy if kids learned anything at all from this movie.",

The beginning was promising, if a little slower than I would have liked, and Barbara is a hilarious and relatable character from the get-go, whose motivations and actions are completely understandable. Diana (Gal Gadot) is quaint and charming as usual, and her introduction isn\u2019t bad either. The movie has a real classic feeling to it, with bright colours and over-the-top action scenes - it reminds me of the original Superman movies. Anyway, Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) is also a fair villain in terms of being compelling, even if his plan seems to be a little foggy. Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) also returns for a sweet, fish-out-of-water storyline and some good romantic scenes. The movie does seem a little bloated in that sense, and I think it tries to do way too much. There\u2019s themes of strong vs weak, assault, greed, war, and it\u2019s a period piece (the costumes are GREAT by the way). Most callbacks are great, and Patty Jenkins manages to avoid the sillier aspects of the comics, but as a movie, the story will likely tire you out by the end.",

There were so many moving parts, what with the oil plot, Alastair being a thing, Diana and Steve, Diana randomly wanting to fly, Barbara, the \u201cTruth vs Lies\u201d motif that tried to justify the MacGuffin, and the giant metal suit (that for some reason didn\u2019t get electrocuted?). Just confusing. The scene where the world is dying and Diana is flying is so strange as well. Also how does she talk to the whole world without a camera? It\u2019s just confusing. Anyway, the part with her losing her powers and then giving up Steve to get them back and save everyone is cool. That should have been the main story. Also I kinda expected Max to die at the beginning when he wished to be a wish stone (doesn\u2019t sound like a very responsible wish).

Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) was a mature leader, Batman (Ben Affleck) was a responsible protagonist, Aquaman (Jason Momoa) towed the line between uncaring and heroic very well, while Flash (Ezra Miller) was comedic and compelling at the same time. Cyborg was by far the most improved performer this time around, with his arc and relationship with his father (Joe Morton) basically acting as the framework for the movie. His backstory, abilities, and emotional journey was much better explained here. Darkseid (Ray Porter) and DaSaad (Peter Guiness) had just the right amount of ominous energy, with reverence from Steppenwolf, and the parademons didn\u2019t have too much of the spotlight.

The focus on Lois Lane (Amy Adams) paid off well, even if most of the superman scenes weren\u2019t that great - I think the one thing I liked about the original better was superman\u2019s role in the finale. That said, Martian Manhunter\u2019s (Harry Lenix) role here was really quite interesting, in the same way that Nick Fury showed up in Iron Man. The dream sequence at the end was pure genius, and would have built up SO much hype for the sequel if we didn\u2019t already know there wasn\u2019t going to be one. Wonderful storytelling, and I\u2019m glad that the Joker (Jared Leto) could redeem himself with this performance. As always, Alfred (Jeremy Irons) was perfect, Martha (Diane Lane) wasn\u2019t bad, Vulko (Willem Dafoe) was a bit random, and Mera (Amber Heard) had a strange British accent here. Ryan Choi (Kai Zheng) was a nice easter egg, even if I was surprised they didn\u2019t work in a Green Lantern somewhere. Either way, definitely a great showing. The Unity was an awesome idea, and the Anti-Life sounds like it would be a great arc in the future. Kudos to Snyder, and I\u2019m glad we got to see his original vision.",
