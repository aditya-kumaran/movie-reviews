    "rewatchability": "Extremely High - reveals new layers with each viewing",
    "bestCharacterWinner": "Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio)",
    "review": "Christopher Nolan delivers a masterpiece that challenges the boundaries of storytelling. The film weaves through multiple layers of dreams with precision, creating a heist movie unlike any other. Hans Zimmer's iconic score elevates every scene, and the ensemble cast delivers performances that ground the fantastical premise in genuine emotion. The practical effects combined with seamless CGI create dreamscapes that feel both impossible and tangible.",
    "spoilerReview": "The ending's ambiguity is pure genius. Whether the top falls or not becomes irrelevant - Cobb has chosen to be present with his children, reality be damned. The Mal subplot adds tragic depth, and the snow fortress sequence remains one of the most ambitious action set pieces ever filmed. The kick synchronization across dream levels is editing perfection.",

    "bestCharacterWinner": "Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho)",
    "review": "Bong Joon-ho crafts a genre-defying masterpiece that seamlessly blends dark comedy, thriller, and social drama. The Kim family's infiltration of the wealthy Park household becomes a devastating commentary on class inequality. Every frame is meticulously composed, every scene serves multiple purposes, and the tonal shifts are executed with surgical precision. This is cinema at its absolute finest.",
    "spoilerReview": "The basement reveal completely recontextualizes everything. The flooding sequence juxtaposing the Kim family's tragedy with the Parks' oblivious party is heartbreaking. Ki-taek's final act of violence feels both shocking and inevitable. The ending's fantasy sequence about buying the house is devastating in its impossibility - a dream that can never be achieved.",

    "review": "Denis Villeneuve accomplishes what many thought impossible - bringing Frank Herbert's dense novel to life with both fidelity and cinematic grandeur. The scale is breathtaking, the sandworms are terrifying, and Arrakis feels like a real, lived-in world. The sound design deserves special mention; every ornithopter flight and sandworm emergence is visceral. While it's clearly half a story, it's a magnificent half.",

    "bestCharacterWinner": "Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh)",
    "review": "The Daniels have created something truly special - a multiverse story that uses its infinite possibilities to explore the finite, precious nature of our relationships. Michelle Yeoh delivers a career-defining performance, and the film's visual creativity is matched only by its emotional intelligence. It's simultaneously the most absurd and most heartfelt film in years.",
    "spoilerReview": "The googly eyes as a symbol of finding joy in absurdity is brilliant. Waymond's 'be kind' philosophy being the actual solution subverts action movie expectations beautifully. The hot dog fingers universe somehow becomes genuinely moving. Joy's nihilism being defeated not by logic but by unconditional love is the film's masterstroke.",

    "review": "Matt Reeves delivers the most grounded and detective-focused Batman yet. Robert Pattinson's brooding, damaged Bruce Wayne feels fresh, and Gotham has never looked more atmospheric. The film leans heavily into noir and horror elements, creating a Batman film that feels genuinely unsettling. The three-hour runtime is felt, but the mood is intoxicating.",

    "bestCharacterWinner": "J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy)",
    "review": "Nolan transforms the story of the atomic bomb into a haunting character study. Cillian Murphy disappears into Oppenheimer, conveying the weight of world-changing decisions through subtle, devastating performance. The Trinity test sequence is cinema at its most powerful - terrifying without showing destruction. The film asks uncomfortable questions about scientific responsibility that remain relevant today.",
    "spoilerReview": "The Strauss reveal reframes the entire black-and-white timeline brilliantly. The 'I am become death' moment is handled with restraint that makes it more powerful. The final conversation with Einstein, revealed at the end, is chilling. Oppenheimer's vision of nuclear apocalypse during his 'victory' speech is the film's most haunting image.",

Emma Stone commits fully to Bella's journey from childlike innocence to self-actualized woman, delivering a fearless performance. The production design is extraordinary, creating a steampunk Victorian world that feels both familiar and alien. It's provocative, funny, and surprisingly moving.",

    "review": "Alexander Payne delivers a warm, melancholic gem that feels like a lost 1970s classic. Paul Giamatti is magnificent as the cantankerous teacher, and his chemistry with Dominic Sessa creates genuine emotional resonance. The film takes its time, letting relationships develop naturally, and the period-accurate aesthetic is immersive without being distracting. A perfect antidote to blockbuster fatigue.",

Margot Robbie embodies Barbie perfectly, but Ryan Gosling steals the show with a committed, hilarious Ken. The production design is immaculate, and the film balances corporate product with genuine artistic vision better than it has any right to. Not without flaws, but far more than expected.",

The film explores the roads not taken with devastating subtlety, and the three leads deliver performances of remarkable nuance. Every glance, every pause carries weight. The final scene is one of the most emotionally complex endings in recent memory. A quiet film that echoes loudly.",
    "spoilerReview": "The genius is that there's no villain - Arthur is wonderful, Hae Sung is wonderful, and Nora made the right choice for herself. The final Uber ride, with Nora crying while Hae Sung watches Seoul disappear, then returning to Arthur's arms, captures the beautiful tragedy of lives that could have been. In-yun becomes not just a concept but the film's beating heart.",

    "review": "Scorsese delivers a sprawling, devastating account of the Osage murders that refuses to look away from American evil. Lily Gladstone is revelatory, conveying Mollie's dignity and grief with remarkable restraint. The film's length is both its strength and weakness - it's exhaustive but exhausting. DiCaprio's Ernest is fascinatingly pathetic, a man too weak to be good.",

Every frame is a work of art, with each universe having its own distinct animation style. The story takes bold swings, and the cliffhanger ending is both frustrating and brilliant. This is what animation can be when freed from conventional constraints.",
